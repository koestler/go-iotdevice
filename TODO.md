# Todos
- mqttDevice:
 - implement command topic / handling of relays
 - implement available / unavailable messages correctly
   - when receiver mqtt connection closed,
   - when sender mqtt connection closed mqtt connection closed
   - when device is disconnected (modbus / http etc.)
   - mqttDevice: implement available / unavailable messages
- check what happens with a http connection not able to handle the bandwidth required by the subscription. This probably stalls the whole storage.
- stream register structure update via websocket to client
- http device: remove registers that are not present anymore
- test RegisterFilter for all different device types
