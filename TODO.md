# Todos
- redo / check homeassistant integration using mqtt realtime messages
- mqttDevice:
 - separate structure and values in different topics
 - allow filter for realtime message by register / category (like hassDiscovery)
 - implement command topic / handling of relays
 - implement available / unavailable messages correctly
   - when receiver mqtt connection closed,
   - when sender mqtt connection closed mqtt connection closed
   - when device is disconnected (modbus / http etc.)
- come up with a generic register filter usable for mqtt messages, hass discovery, views etc.
- use this filter to replace the RealtimeViaMqttClient and TelemetryViaMqttClient; if not possible, add StructureViaMqttClient
- registerDB: should it check if a register is changed and only send the update if it is?
- mqttDevice: implement available / unavailable messages
