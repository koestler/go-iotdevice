# Todos
- redo / check homeassistant integration using mqtt realtime messages
- mqttDevice:
 - separate structure and values in different topics
 - implement command topic / handling of relays
 - implement available / unavailable messages correctly
   - when receiver mqtt connection closed,
   - when sender mqtt connection closed mqtt connection closed
   - when device is disconnected (modbus / http etc.)
- registerDB: should it check if a register is changed and only send the update if it is?
- mqttDevice: implement available / unavailable messages
- check what happens with a http connection not able to handle the bandwidth required by the subscription. This probably stalls the whole storage.
- steam register structure update via websocket to client
- http device: remove registers that are not present anymore
- do not have any dep on config, user interface instead
- replace topicPrefix by generic map of replacement variables?
- make config yaml unmarshaler strict, use gopkg.in/yaml.v3 ?
