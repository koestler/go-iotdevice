This package was forked from https://github.com/diebietse/invertergui/blob/master/mk2driver and is slightly modified
to support our own logging mechanism.

TODO:
* Can this be achieved by forking the repo on github, having a pull-request for the adapted logging interface merged
into the upstream repo and including it as a dependency?
